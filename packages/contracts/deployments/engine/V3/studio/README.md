## Overview of this Directory

This directory should contain all deployment details for Art Blocks Engine and Engine Flex contracts. It is intended for reference purposes only.

As the Engine and Engine Flex contracts are ERC-1167 compatible, the clones are deployed in batches by calling the Engine Factory. The deployment logs can be referenced here by network and by batch deployment date, i.e `./staging/05-01-24-batch/DEPLOYMENTS.md`
