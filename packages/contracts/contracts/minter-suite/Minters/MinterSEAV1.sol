/**
 * @title Filtered Minter contract that allows tokens to be minted with ETH.
 * Pricing is achieved using an automated serial English Auction mechanism.
 * This is designed to be used with GenArt721CoreContractV3 flagship or
 * engine contracts.
 * @author Art Blocks Inc.
 * @notice This contract was inspired by the release mechanism implemented by
 * nouns.wtf, and we thank them for their pioneering work in this area.

 *********************************
 * @notice Bid Front-Running:
 * Collectors can front-run bids to become the highest bidder by bidding any
 * amount sufficiently higher than the current highest bid, considering the
 * minter-level configured value of `minterMinBidIncrementPercentage`. For
 * instance, if current bid is 1 ETH, and collector A sends a transaction with
 * a bid of 2.50 ETH, collector B may send a transaction with a bid of 2.499
 * ETH, that if successfully front-runs Collector A's transaction, is able to
 * cause collector A's transaction to revert. This is a difficult problem to
 * get around in a decentralized system with public bids, and we have chosen to
 * keep the minter simple and transparent, and leave it up to collectors to
 * understand the risks of front-running and bid accordingly.
 * @notice Token Ownership:
 * This minter contract may own up to two tokens at a time for a given project.
 * The first possible token owned is the token that is currently being 
 * auctioned. During the auction, the token is owned by the minter contract.
 * Once the auction ends, the token is transferred to the winning bidder via a
 * call to "settle" the auction.
 * The second possible token owned is the token that will be auctioned next.
 * This token is minted to and owned by the minter contract whenever possible
 * (i.e. when the project's max invocations has not been reached) when an
 * artist configures their project on this minter, or when a new auction is
 * started. The purpose of this token is to allow users to have a preview of
 * the next token that will be auctioned, even before the auction has started.
 * @notice Privileged Roles and Ownership:
 * This contract is designed to be managed, with limited powers.
 * Privileged roles and abilities are controlled by the core contract's Admin
 * ACL contract and a project's artist. Both of these roles hold extensive
 * power and can modify minter details.
 * Care must be taken to ensure that the admin ACL contract and artist
 * addresses are secure behind a multi-sig or other access control mechanism.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to the core contract's Admin ACL
 * contract:
 * - ejectNextTokenTo
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to this minter's minter filter's
 * Admin ACL contract:
 * - updateMinterTimeBufferSeconds
 * - updateRefundGasLimit
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to a project's artist:
 * - syncProjectMaxInvocationsToCore
 * - manuallyLimitProjectMaxInvocations
 * - configureFutureAuctions
 * - tryPopulateNextToken
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to a project's artist or the core
 * contract's Admin ACL contract:
 * - resetFutureAuctionDetails
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Additional admin and artist privileged roles may be described on other
 * contracts that this minter integrates with.
 *
 * @dev Note that while this minter makes use of `block.timestamp` and it is
 * technically possible that this value is manipulated by block producers, such
 * manipulation will not have material impact on the ability for collectors to
 * place a bid before auction end time. This is due to the admin-configured
 * `minterTimeBufferSeconds` parameter, which will used to ensure that
 * collectors have sufficient time to place a bid after the final bid and
 * before the auction end time.
