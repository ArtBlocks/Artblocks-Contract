## Overview of this Directory

This directory is intended to include all Art Blocks Engine smart contract source code, as well as any other relevant information about the contracts. It is for archival purposes only, and is not intended to be used for development.

The code in this directory is intended to be deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, and is not intended to be run locally.

The source code is intended to be compileable if a given directory is copied to the `/contracts/engine/` directory. However, these files will not be maintained and updated as the repository is updated over time, so imports may not work.

All contracts deployed should have a corresponding deployment log in the `DEPLOYMENTS.md` file in the [`/deployments/engine/`](https://github.com/ArtBlocks/artblocks-contracts/tree/main/packages/contracts/deployments/engine) directory.
