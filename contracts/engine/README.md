## Overview of this Directory

This directory is intended to contain all common Art Blocks Engine smart contract source code, as well as any other relevant information about contracts that are in development. That may include directories specific to each partner prior to mainnet deployments.

## Data Management Process

After a partner's contracts are deployed to mainnet and no longer in development, the contracts should be migrated to the `/posterity/engine/` directory.

Note: any deployment logs should be maintained in the `/scripts/engine/<partner>/` directory.
