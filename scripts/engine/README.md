## Overview of this Directory

This directory should contain all deployment scripts for Art Blocks Engine partner contracts. It is for archival purposes only, and is not intended to be used for development.

All relevant deployment logs should be included in the `DEPLOYMENTS.md` file in the `scripts/engine/<partner>` directory.

All mainnet deployments that occurred after 10 Jan, 2023 should have a corresponding tag+release in the GitHub repository. This is to ensure that Art Blocks provides a well-documented contract deployment history and that the code deployed to mainnet can easily be verified by anyone.
