## Deployed Contract Details

### Core Contract Versions

This is the Smart contract that controls the artwork created by the artist. No financial transactions occur on this Smart contract.

Core contracts use the versioning schema below:

| Description | Version | Project Range | Mainnet Address |
|:-----------:|:-------:|:-------------:|:----------------|
| Original AB Core | V0 | 0-2 | 0x059EDD72Cd353dF5106D2B9cC5ab83a52287aC3a |
| Revised AB Core | V1 | 3+ | 0xa7d8d9ef8D8Ce8992Df33D8b8CF4Aebabd5bD270 |
| PBAB/PRTNR Cores | V2 | All PBAB, All PRTNR | Various - see PBAB directory [DEPLOYMENTS.md files](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AArtBlocks%2Fartblocks-contracts+extension%3Amd+filename%3ADEPLOYMENTS&type=Code&ref=advsearch&l=&l=) |
| Current Draft AB Core | V3 | (TBR) | - |

### MinterFilter Suite Compatibility Chart
- We like new minters
- Minters have to iteract with (at least one) core contract

**Thus:** The minter suite compatability chart!

| Minter Suite Version | Compatible Core Contract Version | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *V0 | V1 | expect `projectTokenInfo()` to change in future core contract versions (since price & currency data is now stored on V0 minters) |
| *V1 | V1 | expect `projectTokenInfo()` to change in future core contract versions (since price & currency data is now stored on V0 minters) |
| *V1_PRTNR | V2_PBAB | expect `projectTokenInfo()` to change in future core contract versions (since price & currency data is now stored on V0 minters) |

### Active Minting Contract(s)

These are the smart contracts that receive funds, and split them between the artist(s) and the platform. Artists receive funds directly from these contracts.

## Contract Documentation
Documentation for contracts may be generated via `yarn docgen`. Some Art Blocks contracts use [NatSpec](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/natspec-format.html#documentation-example) comments to automatically enrich generated documentation. Some contracts use [dynamic expressions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/natspec-format.html#dynamic-expressions) to improve user experience.

### Old contracts/addresses:
* **Primary Sales and Minting Contract (no longer in use) [0x059edd72cd353df5106d2b9cc5ab83a52287ac3a](https://etherscan.io/address/0x059edd72cd353df5106d2b9cc5ab83a52287ac3a)**
  * This is the original Art Blocks smart contract which had a built in minter. This contract represents only projects 0 (Chromie Squiggle), 1 (Genesis), 2 (Construction Token) and handled both control of the NFTs and the purchase transactions. This smart contract received funds and automatically split them between the artist and the platform.
* Secondary Sales Receiving and Sending Address (no longer in use) [0x8e9398907d036e904fff116132ff2be459592277](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8e9398907d036e904fff116132ff2be459592277)
  * This address received secondary market royalties from https://opensea.io until July 29th 2021. These royalties were subsequently distributed to artists directly from this address. After July 29th the secondary royalty address was changes to the current one on the first page of this doc.

## Royalty Registry Overrides
Art Blocks supports lookups of all mainnet flagship and PBAB tokens on the [Royalty Registry](https://royaltyregistry.xyz/lookup).

These contracts delegate all permissions to the core contracts. The following Royalty Registry override contracts are deployed at:

- **mainnet (AB deployed):**
  - AB Flagship royalty override: https://etherscan.io/address/0x7b5369c24a47a72ecf932bf6974f506dde4d5eb1#code
  - PBAB royalty override: https://etherscan.io/address/0x31e1cc72e6f9e27c2ecbb500d978de1691173f5f#code
  - PRTNR royalty override: <TBD>

- **mainnet (RR deployed):**
  - RoyaltyRegistry: https://etherscan.io/address/0xad2184fb5dbcfc05d8f056542fb25b04fa32a95d#code
  - RoyaltyEngineV1: https://etherscan.io/address/0x0385603ab55642cb4dd5de3ae9e306809991804f#code

### Configuring PBAB Royalty Override (REQUIRED)
Upon deploying a PBAB contract, the following steps must be taken:
>Tasks denoted by (scripted) are included in `scripts/1_reference_pbab_suite_deployer.ts`, and scripted for newly deployed PBAB projects as of 03/2022.

- **(scripted), REQUIRED** Set the royalty lookup address on the royalty registry for the newly deployed contract
  - Go to the [Royalty Registry](https://royaltyregistry.xyz/lookup) and call the following function on the Royalty Registry smart contract:
    - `setRoyaltyLookupAddress(<new_PBAB_coreAddr>, <PBAB_royaltyOverrideContract>)`
- **(scripted), REQUIRED** Set Platform royalty payment address for the new core contract in PBAB royalty override contract
    >note: This step is optional in the PBAB deployer script in case platform royalty payment address is not known at time of deployment, but must be completed before royalty lookups will work
  - `admin` of the PBAB core contract must call the following function on the PBAB royalty override contract:
    - `updatePlatformRoyaltyAddressForContract(<new_PBAB_coreAddr>, <platformRoyaltyPaymentAddress>)`

Additionally, the following settings may be configured/changed by a PBAB core contract's `admin` at any time:
- **Change Royalty Percentages**
    - `renderProvider` or `platform` Royalty [BPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp) may be changed from default values of 2.5% to any value. This can be configured by a PBAB core contract's `admin` via the PBAB override contract's functions `updateRenderProviderBpsForContract` and `updatePlatformBpsForContract`.
- **Change Platform Royalty Payment Address**
    - The address to receive platform royalty payments may be updated by a PBAB core contract's admin via the PBAB override contract's function `updatePlatformRoyaltyAddressForContract`.
- **Change Render Provider Royalty Payment Address**
    - The address to receive render provider royalty payments is delegated to the token core contract, and defined as the public variable `renderProviderAddress`.

### Configuring PRTNR Royalty Override (REQUIRED)
Upon deploying a Partner (PRTNR) contract, the following steps must be taken.
>Note that the only difference between a PRTNR and PBAB override is that PRTNR override contracts assume no platform payment address or percentage.

- **REQUIRED** Set the royalty lookup address on the royalty registry for the newly deployed contract
  - Go to the [Royalty Registry](https://royaltyregistry.xyz/lookup) and call the following function on the Royalty Registry smart contract:
    - `setRoyaltyLookupAddress(<new_PRTNR_coreAddr>, <PRTNR_royaltyOverrideContract>)`

Additionally, the following settings may be configured/changed by a the PRTNR core contract's `admin` at any time:
- **Change Royalty Percentages**
    - `renderProvider` Royalty [BPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp) may be changed from default values of 2.5% to any value. This can be configured by a PRTNR core contract's `admin` via the PRTNR override contract's function `updateRenderProviderBpsForContract`.
- **Change Render Provider Royalty Payment Address**
    - The address to receive render provider royalty payments is delegated to the token core contract, and defined as the public variable `renderProviderAddress`.

### Configuring Art Blocks Flagship Royalty Override  (REQUIRED)
Upon deploying a new Art Blocks flagship core contract, the following steps must be taken (NOT scripted):

- **REQUIRED** Set the royalty lookup address on the royalty registry for the newly deployed contract
  - Go to the [Royalty Registry](https://royaltyregistry.xyz/lookup) to call the following function on the Royalty Registry smart contract:
    - `setRoyaltyLookupAddress(<new_coreAddr>, <ArtBlocks_royaltyOverrideContract>)`
- **REQUIRED** Set Art Blocks royalty payment address for the new core contract in the royalty override contract
  - `admin` of core contract must call:
    - `updateArtblocksRoyaltyAddressForContract(<new_coreAddr>, <ArtBlocksRoyaltyPaymentAddress>)`

Additionally, the following settings may be configured/changed by a core contract's `admin` at any time:
- **Change Art Blocks Royalty Percentage**
    - Royalty [BPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp) may be changed from default values of 2.5% to any value less than or equal to the default (cannot be increased above default). This can be configured by a core contract's `admin` via the  override contract's function `updateArtblocksBpsForContract`.
- **Change Art Blocks Royalty Payment Address**
    - The address to receive Art Blocks royalty payments may be updated by a core contract's admin via the royalty override contract's function `updateArtblocksRoyaltyAddressForContract`.

### Running Gas Reports for Solidity Methods & Deployments
Your `.env` file should contain a `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` param in order to calculate ethereum gas costs. The key value can be found in the Engineering team's shared 1Password acccount. Additionally, you'll need to add the following object within the `module.exports` key in hardhat.config.ts:
```
  gasReporter: {
    currency: "USD",
    gasPrice: 100,
    enabled: true,
    coinmarketcap: process.env.COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY
  }
```
After this config is finished, you'll notice a `usd (avg)` column in the auto-generated table that's printed when you run unit tests with `yarn test`.
(note: gasPrice is a variable param that reflects the gwei/gas cost of a tx)
